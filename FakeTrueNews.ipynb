              "21412  'Fully committed' NATO backs new U.S. approach on AfghanistanBRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO allies on Tuesday welcomed President Donald Trump s decision to commit more forces to Afghanistan, as part of a new U.S. strategy he said would require more troops and funding from America s partners. Having run for the White House last year on a pledge to withdraw swiftly from Afghanistan, Trump reversed course on Monday and promised a stepped-up military campaign against  Taliban insurgents, saying:  Our troops will fight to win .  U.S. officials said he had signed off on plans to send about 4,000 more U.S. troops to add to the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. But his speech did not define benchmarks for successfully ending the war that began with the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and which he acknowledged had required an   extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure .

The issue of academic freedom in China hit the headlines this week after the leading British academic publisher,  Cambridge University Press, said it had complied with a request to block online access to some scholarly articles in China.  It later reversed its position.   Earlier this year LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions in China was asked to remove some content from its database,  LexisNexis said in a statement.  In March 2017, the company withdrew two products (Nexis and LexisNexis Academic) from the Chinese market.  LexisNexis is owned by information group Relx.       0\n",

This place is like an island,  said Yegor, 21, who works at  popular bar Hooligan.  It s the street of freedom.  The government of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for the past 23 years and has boasted that he is  the last and only dictator in Europe  ,has little tolerance for any opposition. A powerful police force and feared state security  keep citizens in check. But police patrols are rare in Oktyabrskaya, partly due to its location on an out-of-the-way peninsula in a bend of the river Svislach.

Parolin, speaking at a joint news conference in Moscow alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, did not give any date for such a possible visit. The Eastern and Western branches of Christianity split apart in 1054. The pope, leader of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics, is seeking to improve ties, and last year in Cuba held what was the first ever meeting between a Roman Catholic pope and a Russian Orthodox patriarch.  Parolin said he had also used his talks in the Russian capital to also raise certain difficulties faced by the Catholic Church in Russia.

The Southeast Asian country has pledged to ship up to $570 million worth of commodities in addition to cash to pay for the Suhkoi SU-35 fighter jets, which are expected to be delivered in stages starting in two years. Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said in a joint statement with Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu that details of the type and volume of commodities were  still being negotiated . Previously he had said the exports could include palm oil, tea, and coffee.

        "Binary text classification is pretty old task in ML and AI world and has been solved already by many models, so I didn't want to complicate the solution and decided to use 'classical' models for such task: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. As third model I added 'almighty' XGBoost model, as this model usually shows very high scores, was interesting to see how much it will win over the classic and older models. I considered to choose some model from deep learning, but in the end I decided to give up the idea as the input dataset is quite voluminous and would require a lot of resources and time to set up all parameters for better preformance (even with resampling). \n",
        "\n",
        "So after training and prediction phases for all three models, unsurprisingly XGBoost showed best metrics. To be honest, the metrics are too high, probably I overfit the model. And if I had more time, I would do more experiments like taking less training data (now it's 80% of dataset) and would try to test models with the data that wasn't in the input dataset (so to say, 'uknown' for models). Another option is to manipulate with parameters for XGBoost and SVM but, again, for binary classification task, I would assume, there are not so many options. I think, if it was a productive task, I would stick to SVM or XGboost as they have more flexibility in compare to Naive Bayes."
